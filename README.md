## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of masters degree of Algorithmic Computer Science at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology

I currently posess an engineers degree in computer science. My engineers thesis can be seen [here](https://github.com/Yarowit/Engineers-Thesis).

Here are the projects and subjects I have worked on during my studies:

* Highschool project - [Sferogebra](https://github.com/Yarowit/Sferogebra)
* [First year](https://github.com/Yarowit/First-Year) of my studies
  * [checkers](https://github.com/pawc02/Warcaby) project
* [Second year](https://github.com/stars/Yarowit/lists/second-year) of my studies
  * [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/Yarowit/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures)
  * [Discrete Optimization Algorithms](https://github.com/Yarowit/Discrete-Optimization-Algorithms)
  * [Computer Architecture and Operating Systems](https://github.com/Yarowit/Computer-Architecture-and-Operating-Systems)
  * [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Yarowit/Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence)
  * [Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/Yarowit/Probability-and-Statistics)
  * [Mobile Applications](https://github.com/Yarowit/Mobile-Applications)
  * [Gitpad](https://github.com/mikolaj2002/GitPad) - group web project
* [Third year](https://github.com/stars/Yarowit/lists/third-year)
  * [Theoretical Fundamentals of Computer Science](https://github.com/Yarowit/Theoretical-Fundamentals-of-Computer-Science)
  * [Formal Languages and Theory of Automata](https://github.com/Yarowit/Formal-Languages-and-Theory-of-Automata)
  * [Scientific Computing](https://github.com/Yarowit/Scientific-Computing)
  * [Coding and Data Compression](https://github.com/Yarowit/Coding-and-Data-Compression)
  * [Metaheuristics](https://github.com/Yarowit/Metaheuristics-Travelling-Salesman-Problem)
  * [Analytic Combinatorics](https://github.com/Yarowit/Analytic-Combinatorics)

I am an active member of a nationwide astronomy club [Almukantarat](https://almukantarat.pl), where I organise camps and meetings for highschool students interested in science

Recently I took part in an ERASMUS exchange with Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I worked on [these](https://github.com/stars/Yarowit/lists/universidad-carlos-iii-de-madrid) subjects:
* [Microprocessors](https://github.com/Yarowit/Microprocessors)
* [Machine Learning Applications](https://github.com/Yarowit/Machine-Learning-Applications)
* [Robotics](https://github.com/Yarowit/Robotics)
* [Real Time Systems](https://github.com/Yarowit/Real-Time-Systems)
* [Simulation in Probability and Statistics](https://github.com/Yarowit/Simulation-in-Probability-and-Statistics)
